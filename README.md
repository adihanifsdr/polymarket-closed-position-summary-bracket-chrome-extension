A Chrome extension that automatically calculates and displays your total profit/loss from your Polymarket betting history.

![Demo](images/demo.jpg)

## Features

- 📊 **Real-time P&L Calculation**: Automatically sums all your wins and losses
- 💰 **Inline Summary**: Displays total profit/loss directly in the Amount Won column header
- 📈 **Statistics**: Shows win count and loss count
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI**: Seamlessly integrates with Polymarket's existing design
- ⚡ **Auto-updates**: Updates when you load more betting history

## Installation

### Method 1: Load Unpacked Extension (Development)

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top right corner)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `chrome-extension` folder from this project
5. The extension is now installed!

### Method 2: Create Icon Files (Optional)

The extension requires icon files. You can create simple icons or use placeholders:

#### Quick Method - Create Basic Icons:

Run these commands in the `chrome-extension` folder to create basic colored square icons:

```bash
# For macOS/Linux:
convert -size 16x16 xc:#10b981 icon16.png
convert -size 48x48 xc:#10b981 icon48.png
convert -size 128x128 xc:#10b981 icon128.png

# Or create them with any image editor as solid green squares
```

## Usage

1. Go to [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com)
2. Navigate to your profile/betting history page
3. The P&L summary will automatically appear in the "Amount Won" column header
4. The summary shows:
   - **Total P&L**: Your total profit or loss (green for profit, red for loss)
   - **Stats**: Win count and loss count (e.g., "13W / 2L")

## How It Works

The extension:
1. Scans the Polymarket page for betting history entries
2. Extracts profit/loss amounts from each bet
3. Calculates the total sum
4. Displays the result in a fixed widget on the right side

## File Structure

```
chrome-extension/
├── manifest.json       # Extension configuration
├── content.js          # Main logic for parsing and calculation
├── styles.css          # Widget styling
├── README.md          # This file
└── icon*.png          # Extension icons (need to be created)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Widget Not Appearing
- Make sure you're on the Polymarket betting history page
- Try refreshing the page
- Check that the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`

### Incorrect Calculations
- The extension reads values as they appear on the page
- If Polymarket changes their HTML structure, the extension may need updates
- Try clicking "Load more" to ensure all bets are loaded

### Icons Missing Error
If you see an icon error, either:
1. Create simple PNG icons (16x16, 48x48, 128x128 pixels)
2. Or remove the "icons" section from `manifest.json` temporarily

## Development
