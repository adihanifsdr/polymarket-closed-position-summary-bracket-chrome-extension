# Quick Installation Guide

## Step 1: Install the Extension

1. Open Google Chrome
2. Type `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar and press Enter
3. Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle in the top-right corner
4. Click the **Load unpacked** button
5. Navigate to and select this folder: `chrome-extension`
6. Click **Select Folder**

## Step 2: Verify Installation

You should see "Polymarket P&L Calculator" in your extensions list with a green checkmark.

## Step 3: Use the Extension

1. Go to [https://polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com)
2. Log in to your account
3. Navigate to your profile/betting history
4. Look at the "AMOUNT WON" column header - you'll see:
   - **Total P&L:** Your total profit or loss
   - **(XW / YL)** Win and loss counts

## Troubleshooting

### Summary Not Showing Up?

**Check you're on the right page:**
- The summary only appears on pages with betting history
- Make sure you're logged in to Polymarket
- Look in the "AMOUNT WON" column header (top right area)

**Try these fixes:**
1. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. Make sure the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
3. Check the browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
4. Wait a moment - it may take 1-2 seconds to appear

### Numbers Look Wrong?

- The extension sums the "Amount Won" column from your visible betting history
- If you have many bets, click "Load more" to load them all
- The summary will automatically update as more bets load

### Extension Won't Install?

- Make sure you're using Google Chrome (not Brave, Edge, or other browsers)
- Ensure Developer mode is enabled
- Check that you selected the correct `chrome-extension` folder
